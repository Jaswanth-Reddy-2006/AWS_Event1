## 📊 Workflow Overview

### Step 1: Registration
```
User fills form:
├── Team Name
├── Team Lead Info
└── 3 Members:
    ├── CTO (Cloud Architect)
    │   ├── Name
    │   └── Password (must be strong)
    ├── CFO (Financial Analyst)
    │   ├── Name
    │   └── Password (must be strong)
    └── PM (Growth Lead)
        ├── Name
        └── Password (must be strong)

Backend validates:
✓ Password requirements met
✓ All 3 roles present
✓ Hash passwords with bcryptjs
✓ Store in MongoDB

Return:
✓ Team ID (e.g., TT-2026-0042)
✓ Show success message
```

### Step 2: Login
```
Each team member logs in separately:
├── Enter Team ID (shared by team lead)
├── Select Their Role (CTO/CFO/PM)
├── Enter Their Name (case-insensitive)
├── Enter Their Password

Backend validates:
✓ Team exists
✓ Member name matches (case-insensitive)
✓ Role matches (case-insensitive)
✓ Password is correct (bcrypt comparison)

If valid:
✓ Create JWT token
✓ Send token to frontend
✓ Frontend stores token

User sees:
✓ Profile page with Team ID and members
```

### Step 3: Access Protected Pages
```
When accessing:
├── /training
├── /questions/1
├── /leaderboard
└── /admin

Frontend:
✓ Sends JWT token in header
✓ Authorization: Bearer <token>

Backend:
✓ Verifies JWT signature
✓ Checks token expiration
✓ Grants access if valid

Result:
✓ User sees role-specific content
```

## 🔑 JWT & Security Details

### What is JWT_SECRET?

It's a secret key used to create and verify secure tokens. Current value:
```
cloud-tycoon-aws-learning-game-2026-super-secret-key-please-change-in-production-use-32-char-string
```

### For Development
- Current JWT_SECRET is good enough
- Passwords require strong format
- Tokens expire in 7 days
- Passwords are hashed in database

### For Production (Before Event)
- Change JWT_SECRET to: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- Update in Heroku config variables
- Use HTTPS only
- Keep JWT_SECRET secret

See `JWT_AND_AUTHENTICATION.md` for complete details.

## 🛠️ How to Start

### 1. Ensure MongoDB is Running

**Local MongoDB:**
```bash
mongod
# Should show: waiting for connections on port 27017
```

**Or use MongoDB Atlas** (already configured in .env):
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### 2. Start Backend

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Connected to MongoDB
🚀 Cloud-Tycoon Backend running on port 5000
```

### 3. Start Frontend

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Browser opens to http://localhost:3000**

### 4. Test Registration

Go to http://localhost:3000 and follow "Test Case 1" above.

3. Each member logs in separately
4. All see correct Team ID and members
✓ PASS
```

### Scenario 2: Team Member Forgets Password
```
1. Team member tries to login
2. Enters wrong password
3. See: "❌ Incorrect password."
4. Can try again
✓ PASS (but note: no password reset feature yet)
```

### Scenario 3: Security Check
```
1. Try password: "weak"
2. See requirements not met
3. Try password: "WeakPass1!"

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Current MVP (Good for Testing)
- ❌ No password reset feature (no email backend)
- ❌ No admin login required (anyone can access /admin)
- ❌ No 2FA/MFA (not needed for classroom event)
- ❌ Token stored in memory (lost on page refresh) - can add localStorage if needed
- ⏳ Single device per account (user can log in from multiple devices, last one wins)

### Planned for Later
- Password reset via email
- Admin authentication
- Two-factor authentication
- Session management (limit logins per account)
- Rate limiting on login attempts

---

## 📞 Support

### If Backend Won't Start
See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Port issues section

### If Frontend Won't Start
See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Dependencies section

### If Login Fails
- Check Team ID spelling
- Check name matches registration (case doesn't matter)
- Check password is exactly correct
- Ensure backend is running
- Check browser console (F12)

### If Profile Page Doesn't Load
- Ensure JWT token was received at login
- Check browser network tab (F12 → Network)
- Verify backend is running
- Check backend logs for errors

5. Test password visibility toggle

### Short Term (Next 2-4 hours)
1. Add Year 2 questions to seedDatabase.js
2. Add Year 3 questions
3. Run `npm run seed` to populate database
4. Test full 3-year flow

### Medium Term (Before Event)
1. User test with 10 students
2. Fix any bugs found
3. Deploy to MongoDB Atlas + Heroku + Vercel
4. Generate production JWT_SECRET
5. Train proctors on admin dashboard
